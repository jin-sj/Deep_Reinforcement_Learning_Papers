# Deep Reinforcement Learning Papers
List of RL papers and personal notes.
I'll be following the Feynman Technique style on my notes. Fooling oneself is the easiest, it often happens where
I claim I know the material and move along, but this technique will delve down and really find what terms I fully understand
and which terms I don't.
To learn more about theFeynman Technique, take a look at [Feynman Technique][https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230].
